To use:

Pushing jobs:

$pheanstalk = majaxPheanstalk::getInstance();
$pheanstalk->useTube('test_tube')->put('Job data');




To run jobs:

Create a worker, modeled after ExampleWorkerThread in lib/thread/, which extends majaxPheanstalkWorkerThread and implements doRun().

<?php

class ExampleWorkerThread extends majaxPheanstalkWorkerThread
{
  protected function doRun()
  {
    $job = $this->getJob('test_tube');
    $data = $job->getData();
    $this->log('Got data: '.$data);
    $this->deleteJob($job);
  }
}

?>


Now you're ready to run the task!


./symfony pheanstalk:run_worker ExampleWorkerThread /path/to/store/log/in/

Easy-peasy
